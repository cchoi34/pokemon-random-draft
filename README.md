# Pokemon Randomizer Draft

Create your own random draft Pokemon Challenge with a friend! 

## How to play

Create an account, and start up a draft based on presets to your liking. Defaults are set to Generation 3, Legendaries allowed, no Wonder guard and no hindering abilities. 
Just like picking a starter pokemon, you can then draft one random pokemon, four random moves, and one random ability shown on the screen. Go through ten rounds of this.
Out of the 10 Pokemon, 40 moves and 10 abilities you drafted, you can then mix and match all the above to create a team of 6 Pokemon to your liking. 
Export this team and bring it into Pokemon Showdown to battle your friends!
